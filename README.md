This is an example that illustrates how to use [angular-delite](http://github.com/ibm-js/angular-delite) wrappers to bring any [deliteful](http://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful) widget or [dstore](http://github.com/sitepen/dstore) store into the context of an AngularJS application.
It's connected to a REST backend hosted on [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).
