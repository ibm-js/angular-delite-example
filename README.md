This is an example that illustrates how to use [angular-delite](http://github.com/tkrugg/angular-delite) wrappers to bring any [deliteful](http://github.com/ibm-js/deliteful) widget or [dstore](http://github.com/sitepen/dstore) store into the context of an AngularJS application.


## Getting started 

1. Clone the project

	```
$ git clone git@github.com:tkrugg/angular-delite.git
	```

2. Install all dependencies

	```
$ npm install 
$ bower install
	```
3. Launch the build. This will create a `app.min.js` file in your root directory.

	```
