## Element Instantiation

See [`delite/Widget`](/delite/docs/master/Widget.md) for full details on how instantiation lifecycle is working.

### Declarative Instantiation

```html
<html>
  <button is="d-button">I am a Button!</button>
</html>
```

### Programmatic Instantiation

```js
  require([
    "delite/register",
    "deliteful/Button"
  ], function (register, button) {
     var b = new Button({label: "I am a Button"});
     b.placeAt(document.body);
     b.startup();
});
```

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Element Configuration

The following properties can be set on the widget to configure it:

* `label`: the label to display in the button;
* `iconClass`: DOM class to apply to a DOM node before the label in order to render an icon;
* `showLabel`: set it to true so that the button only displays an icon (especially useful for buttons in toolbars).

The `disabled` attribute is also supported, in order to disable the button. A disabled button appears as disabled and does not emit any event when clicked.

* `d-button-blue` can be added to render a blue button;
* `d-button-red` can be added to render a red button.

Custom classes can also be added, as in the following example:
